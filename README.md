# BookListingApp
App that allows you to search books - project done as part of Udacity's course Android Basics: Networking

To run this app, search for the 'TODO: Insert key here:' and replace with your own key. You can get one here: https://developers.google.com/books/

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

The goal is to create a Book listing app which gives the user the possibility to search for books.

What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:
 - Connecting to an API
 - Parsing the response of the API
 - Handling error cases gracefully
 - Doing network operations independent of the Activity lifecycle
 
## PROJECT SPECIFICATION

### Layout

| CRITERIA | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS |
| --- | --- |
| Overall Layout | App contains a ListView which becomes populated with list items. |
| List Item Layout	| List Items display at least author and title information.|
|Layout Best Practices	| The code adheres to all of the following best practices: Text sizes are defined in sp; Lengths are defined in dp; Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.|
|Text Wrapping	| Information displayed on list items is not crowded.|
|Rotation	| Upon device rotation: The layout remains scrollable; The app should save state and restore the list back to the previously scrolled position; The UI should adjust properly so that all contents of each list item is still visible and not truncated; The Search button should still remain visible on the screen after the device is rotated. |

### Functionality

| CRITERIA | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS |
| --- | --- |
|Runtime Errors |	The code runs without errors.|
|API Call	| The user can enter a word or phrase to serve as a search query. The app fetches book data related to the query via an HTTP request from the Google Books API, using a class such as HttpUriRequest or HttpURLConnection.|
|Response Validation	| The app checks whether the device is connected to the internet and responds appropriately. The result of the request is validated to account for a bad server response or lack of server response.|
|Async Task	| The network call occurs off the UI thread using an AsyncTask or similar threading object.|
|JSON Parsing	| The JSON response is parsed correctly, and relevant information is stored in the app.|
|ListView Population	| The ListView is properly populated with the information parsed from the JSON response.|
|No Data Message	| When there is no data to display, the app shows a default TextView that informs the user how to populate the list.
|External Libraries and Packages	| The intent of this project is to give you practice writing raw Java code using the necessary classes provided by the Android framework; therefore, the use of external libraries for core functionality will not be permitted to complete this project.|

### Code Readability

| CRITERIA | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS |
| --- | --- |
|Naming Conventions	| All variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named such that another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.|
|Format	| The code is properly formatted i.e. there are no unnecessary blank lines; there are no unused variables or methods; there is no commented out code. The code also has proper indentation when defining variables and methods.|
